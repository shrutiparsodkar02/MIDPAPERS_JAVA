ques 1.
	if we are using some variable further in code but we have not initilaize it 
	example class java{
	public static void main (String args[]){
		int k;
		for(int i=0;i<2;i++){
			System.out.println(k);
		}
	}
}

here we have not initialize k 


ques 2.
	we can use substring method
	compare method
	equalTo method
ques 3.
	a--->it is executed as soon as class is loaded 
	it does not need to created object to execute it
	if we have to perform some function only one it then also we can use static block.
	 
	b--->
	line 6 o/p Null
	As it is wrapper class so it will have by default null value
	
	line 8 o/p --> -24
	here we are typecasting int value int to byte
	2024/256 =5 which is odd 
	so we will take modulas then subtract it from value
	so 2024%256   (2 power 8)
	answer 232 
	232-256
	-24
	it will store -24 in byte
